# Martin's Arma 3 Portfolio

Hello! This is where I keep all the experiments in Arma 3 scripting and addon creation that I am proud enough of to see the light of day.

You may not reupload any of these elsewhere but are free to use them for your own mission making or scripting endeavours if you want.

Currently included:

- Tagheeri Armed Forces, a faction addon I created that includes several retextures of existing vehicles within CUP Vehicles, significant config changes to totally transform the CLV_AML addon's Panhard AML-90 into a realistic, balanced vehicle, and a fully fleshed-out faction that serves as a standin for a fictional East African country's military.

- CLV Fixed, an ongoing effort to fix other poorly-configured vehicles within the CLV_Armored addon.

- musicloop.sqf, a script that plays dynamic music at random intervals during a mission, and during combat (e.g. when a sufficiently large number of enemies are alerted to players nearby), escalates it to more intense combat music to help with immersion during the mission.

- A loadout script that enables one to define the equipment used by a faction as a random distribution, with many nuanced features to make loot from enemies feel more natural and surprising.

Stay tuned for more as I see fit to add it!
